I've decided to start a blog, mainly to share the technologies that I am working with and my win's and losses. 

I am using [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] hosted on [GitHub Pages][github-pages].  I love the concept of free hosting on a CDN, and a simple website that doesn't waste more CPU cycles than really necessary.

However, as a [Splunker][splunk] I find the concept of not having access to my weblogs, somewhat limiting.  Maybe I will find a solution for that too.
